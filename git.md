## Git Clients

1. **GitAhead**
    Overall, this is my favorite client, although it is not perfect. My biggest issue is that it does not support signing commits. The configurations are simplistic and somewhat limited, but it gets the job done and has a user friendly interface where functions are easy to find.

2. **GitKraken**
    I tried GitKraken and opted to discontinue as it did not support private repos without moving to paid version. While most repos I work with are public, this would require me to use 2 clients for when I need to access private repos. To address the obvious ... yes, I use a few private repos for personal use. I store some scripts that run in Ubuntu that contain sensitive information, so my intended use is not commercial at all. I also found that GitKraken is buggy with GPG support, at least in Ubuntu. If you have no need for private repos, this is a solid solution.

3. **SmartGit**
    I found it a bit slow at times (I believe due it being programmed in Java) and found the interface a bit complex for quick and easy use. That said, it is a feature full and advanced Git client while free for non commercial use and not restricting access to private repos. If it is a bit cumbersome for regular use, it is worth having around in the case that you need a more advanced Git client.

4. **GitHub Desktop** (The Linux Fork)
    I want to start thanking `shiftkey` (<https://github.com/shiftkey/desktop>) for forking this for us. This forked client is very simplistic and has very few features. While it is a very basic client, it does the basics very well and remains installed for intermittent use.

## IDEs with Integrated or Support for Git

1. **Microsoft Visual Studio Code**
   This is, without question, my favorite IDE with Git support, including commit signing... basically eliminating the need for a separate Git client.

2. **Atom by GitHub**
   While my preferences do not take me to use of Atom often, I believe that wne it comes to development w/ Git, this is a top choice. While loaded with features, my personal preference leans to VSCode. Atom is clearly an alternate #1.

3. **Eclipse**
   Great IDE I like especially for Java. I do not care for the implementation of Git support, but it is there. I see as a close second to VSCode for coding only (not Git), but not really needed is VSCode works for you.

4. **Sublime Text**
   This is a great program and can serve many purposes. However, this comes at last due to being paid and proprietary software. While that is a killer, it deserves to be mentioned as its functionality is great. If you have access to it, great! If not, skip it. As with Eclipse, the Git support is subpar to me. Another discouraging part is that in addition to Text, there is also Merge nad DeepGit
