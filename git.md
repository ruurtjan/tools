# Favorite Git Client

**GitAhead** quickly became my favorite. I tried GitKraken and opted to discontinue as it did not support private repos without moving to paid version. This would require me to use 2 clients, for when I need to access private repos. While most repos I work with are public, I prefer to stick to one software per purose whenever possible.

SmartGit was my second choice. I found it a bit slow at times (I believe due it being programmed in Java) and found the interface a bit complex for quick use. I keep as a second in the cases where I want or need a more advanced client.
